## Overview
As part of implementation, as well as further after, a common set of libraries and services became needed for interacting with Workday, abstracting alot of the nuonces out so that other applications may easily interact with Workday.

These included many ASP.NET microservices, MSSQL databases, Azure File Shares, Azure Functions, and Azure Service Bus Publishers/Subscribers, all in support of integrating Workday with the enterprise.
