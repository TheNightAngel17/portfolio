## Overview
During by time at the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire, I was able to aid in the research of some algebreaic mathematics by creating a custom program that built out n-dimensional objects (namely semi-hypercubes), initiated automorphisms on these entites, evaluated the Hasse Graphs associated to these automorphisms, and constructed a representation of the algebra that was produced by this specific automorphism.
